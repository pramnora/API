## Explanation

The web, now-a-days, contains many API's...; and, these API's allow programmers to 'interact' with other people's/or, company owned software.

The full extent of the what kinds of 'interaction' is allowed...is decided by the API provider themselves.

Most API providers will apply certain restrictions on how their API's can be used...

- what is allowed/or, is not allowed   
- how many users can be running the API all together at once (so as not to clog up their system server/s)  
- etc.
