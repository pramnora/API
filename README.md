## Explanation

The web, now-a-days, contains many API's...; and, these API's allow programmers to 'interact' with other people's/or, company owned software.

The full extent of the what kinds of personal 'interaction' is allowed...is decided by the API provider themselves.

Most API providers will apply certain restrictions on how their API's can be used...

- what is allowed/or, is **not** allowed   
- how *many* users can be running the API all together, at once/(so as not to clog up their system server/s)  
- etc.
